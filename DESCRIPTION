Description: Provides a comprehensive set of S4 classes to represent various 
  human gene types, including both protein-coding and non-coding genes. 
  The package includes constructors, validators, and accessor functions to 
  manage and modify the gene objects created. Each gene object can store 
  its essential information, particularly the Ensembl transcript ID, HUGO 
  symbol, name, description, gene structure, and gene product 
  (the product ID and sequence). In this implementation, each 
  transcript isoform is treated as a separate gene, using the Ensembl 
  transcript ID to simplify the representation and management of gene 
  products, and provide more flexibility.
