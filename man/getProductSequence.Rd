\title{Get the gene product sequence}
\usage{
getProductSequence(object)

\S4method{getProductSequence}{Gene}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Gene object}
}
\value{
the gene product sequence.
}
\description{
This function retrieves the gene product sequence.
}
\details{
This function is defined as a generic function to be applicable
to any object that inherits from the Gene class. The gene product sequence
is stored as the second element in the "gene_product" list.
The function is implemented to provide a more readable output, displaying
the sequence in blocks of 80 bases per line.
